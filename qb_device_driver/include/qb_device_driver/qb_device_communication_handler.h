/**
 * The Communication Handler class is aimed to instantiate a ROS node which provides several ROS services to
 * communicate with one - or many - qbrobotics devices connected to the ROS ecosystem.
 *
 * Each node which manage a single qbrobotics device must register its device ID in the Communication Handler and
 * interact with it through specific ROS services - blocking by nature. The Communication Handler essentially manage
 * the shared serial port resources and lets all the registered nodes to get access to them. This could seem a
 * bottleneck in the architecture, but the real bottleneck is the shared resource itself and it is also necessary
 * since the multi-process nature of ROS does not easily allow to share common resources among distinct processes.
 * Actually the implementation of qbrobotics classes could be reshaped to exploit the multi-threading approach, e.g.
 * using [nodelet](http://wiki.ros.org/nodelet) or similar plugins each device node could handle the communication
 * process by itself, without the intermediary Communication Handler. The advantage of such a restyle in term of
 * communication speed does not worth the effort though.
