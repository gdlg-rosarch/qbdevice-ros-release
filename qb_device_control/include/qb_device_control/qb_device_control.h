 * is given by the \p update() which is called each time the timer triggers (the control loop frequency is settable
 * from the Parameter Server), and which implements the general control law: sensors reading from the device, control
 * action computation according to the loaded controller, and actuator reference commands writing to the hardware. This
 * class also provides a simple waypoints trajectory control which is automatically used in case waypoints are retrieved
